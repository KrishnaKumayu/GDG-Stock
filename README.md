# ðŸ“ˆ ARIMA + LSTM Hybrid Model for Stock Price Prediction

This project combines traditional statistical modeling (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) to forecast stock prices more accurately by capturing both linear and nonlinear patterns in the data.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to leverage the strengths of both ARIMA and LSTM models to improve stock price forecasting performance. The hybrid approach aims to model:

- **Linear components** of stock price behavior using **ARIMA**
- **Nonlinear patterns** using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)**
